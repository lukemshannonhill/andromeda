1) Full compilation
--> Read and parse all source files
--> Do analysis
--> Do transformations
--> Do optimization
--> Write code

2) Run in VM
--> Read and parse all source files
--> Do analysis
--> Run

3) Galaxy check (for testing)
--> Read and parse all GALAXY source files
--> Do analysis

4) Galaxy check and simulation (for testing)
--> Read and parse all GALAXY source files
--> Do analysis

5) Single file compilation (for IDEs)
--> Compile a few files
--> Others need to be stored in memory (see 6)

6) Daemon usage:
--> Parse natives, or all files
--> Do analysis
--> Store for later use
=> CHECK WHICH PARTS OF THE ENV HAVE TO BE C&Ped FOR LATER USE (global functions might be overridden for example)
