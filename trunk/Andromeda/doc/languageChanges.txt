-Packages should now work correctly and you should be able to use qualified names, if necessary
-Scoping and visibility now works correctly
-You only have one namespace for fields, accessors and methods now,
	so you cannot have a method x() if you have a field x.
	This solves some ambiguities.
-You can now enrich almost any type.
-Changes to the visibility system:
		=> things without any visibility modifier are now considered public.
			Using "public" explicitly is deprecated but will still compile.
		=> package visibility nests: If something is package visible, it is
			visible from all files in the same package and from files of subpackages
		=> the modifier "internal" grants package visibility
		=> the "protected" modifier grants package visibility and visibility to all subtypes
		   and enrichments of that type and subtypes.
		=> the private modifier is the same as in java and most other languages:
			Only the same scope can access the values.
			Even enrichments of a class cannot use the classes private fields.
-Improved the generic type system. Now you can not only have generic classes, also structs,
	interfaces and even extensions can be generic.
